It aims to compare different heart tests to understand and reduce future heart problems. You\u2019ve been chosen because of your chest pain symptoms, which might be related to heart disease, even though you don\u2019t have a previous history. \n\nLet\u2019s go over what this involves. If you agree to join, you\u2019ll have a heart test, and you\u2019ll be randomly placed into one of two groups. You might get a test like an Exercise ECG, Stress Echo, or Stress Nuclear imaging, or you might get a Coronary CT Angiography. Each test has its own way of showing how your heart works, which your doctor will help decide. \n\nCould you tell me if you\u2019ve understood so far, or if you have any questions about what we\u2019ve discussed?"

Can you explain a bit more about what happens with these tests and if... if they hurt or how long they'll take? Also, is there something I need to be worried about with these?"
      },
      {
        "role": "AI assistant",
        "content": "Absolutely, I can explain more about the tests. \n\n1. **Exercise ECG**: This test involves walking on a treadmill while your heart activity and blood pressure are monitored. The treadmill gradually speeds up and inclines to assess how your heart responds to exercise. It's non-invasive; the test usually lasts about 10-15 minutes while you walk, plus some time before and after for preparation and recovery.\n\n2. **Stress Echo**: Similar to the Exercise ECG, this starts either with exercising or with medication to make your heart beat faster. An ultrasound takes pictures of your heart before and after the exercise to see how it functions. The entire procedure lasts around 30-60 minutes.\n\n3. **Stress Nuclear**: This involves a small amount of radioactive tracer injected into your vein. You either exercise or get medication to speed up your heart, then lie under a camera that takes images of your heart's blood flow. The test can take a few hours with breaks in between.\n\n4. **Coronary CT Angiography (CTA)**: This is a special type of X-ray that examines your heart's arteries for any blockages using a contrast dye. It's non-invasive and usually takes about 10-30 minutes.\n\n**Risks**: These tests are generally safe, but they can involve some discomfort. For example, if you're not used to exercising, the Exercise ECG might feel strenuous. There's minimal risk of skin irritation from the patches used during these tests. The Stress Nuclear and CTA tests involve exposure to radiation, but it's relatively low and similar to what you\u2019d naturally get over several years. Serious side effects are rare, but if they occur, medical staff will be present to address them quickly.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that these tests help in determining the best treatment for you, or they confirm the absence of heart disease, providing peace of mind.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these tests or the risks involved?"

I don't really like the sound of radiation or injections too much. Is there any chance they'd hurt me or make my chest pain worse? I'm just kind of worried that this might be dangerous, considering my age and everything.\n\nDo I have to prepare anything special for the tests, like not eat or take my meds differently? And what if I get tired during the exercise test\u2014can I stop anytime? Also, will I have to pay for anything, or does insurance cover it? I'm just trying to make sense of how this all fits into my routine and if it's going to be a big hassle or not."

        "content": "It's completely understandable to have concerns, especially with the unfamiliar aspects of these tests. Let\u2019s address your worries one by one:\n\n1. **Safety and Risks**: The radiation levels from the tests such as the Stress Nuclear or CTA are low and comparable to natural background radiation you receive over a few years. The chance of serious harm is very low. The injection for the Stress Nuclear test is a small amount of radioactive tracer, which usually doesn\u2019t cause any side effects, but can cause a mild allergic reaction in rare cases. If any discomfort occurs, especially related to your chest pain, the medical team is fully equipped to handle it.\n\n2. **Preparation**: Generally, for these heart tests, you might be asked to avoid eating or drinking for a few hours beforehand, especially if a contrast dye is used. Your doctor will provide specific instructions on medication adjustments if necessary.\n\n3. **During the Test**: If you feel tired or unwell during the Exercise ECG, yes, you can absolutely stop anytime. It\u2019s important to prioritize your comfort and safety.\n\n4. **Costs**: As for costs, if you undergo the CTA, part of it may be covered by the study\u2019s grant. Some costs might fall on you or your insurance, depending on your coverage. Regular tests like ECGs or lab work would typically be charged to insurance just like any standard care. The study team can help clarify these financial aspects for you.\n\nIn any case, participation is entirely voluntary, and you can choose not to proceed if you feel uncomfortable. There are standard care options available if you prefer.\n\nBased on what we\u2019ve discussed, do you feel ready to consider joining the study, or would you like more information or time to think it over?"

I mean, if something happens during the test\u2014like if my chest pain gets worse or anything\u2014it's comforting to know the medical team will be there to help.\n\nAs for the cost, it's good to hear the study might cover some of it, but I\u2019d still want to know exactly what my insurance would pick up.\n\nYou mentioned not eating before the test. Does that mean I shouldn't take my diabetes medicine or my blood pressure pills in the morning of the test if I'm scheduled to go in?\n\nI guess if there's a chance these tests could really help figure out what's going on with my heart, it's worth considering. But I might need a little more time to wrap my head around the idea. Maybe I should also talk to my family doctor about it first.\n\nWould that be okay? I just want to make sure it's the right step for me."

Here are a few more points to help you consider:\n\n1. **Medication**: Typically, for tests like these, your doctor might advise you on whether to take your diabetes or blood pressure medications on the morning of the test. Often, critical medications are taken with a small sip of water, but it's crucial to get guidance specific to your situation.\n\n2. **Insurance and Costs**: It\u2019s wise to check with your insurance provider to understand what they cover regarding tests and procedures. The study staff can also assist you with understanding any costs, so you won\u2019t face any unexpected charges.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: When you feel ready with more information and after talking with your doctor, you can contact us with your decision or any other questions you might have. Taking time to think and consult with trusted medical professionals and family members is a very sensible approach.\n\nFeel free to reach out anytime\u2014whether it's for more information or if you decide to participate.

First, let me break down what the study involves and what it means for you.\n\nThe study is comparing different heart tests like exercise treadmill testing, stress echocardiogram, and coronary CT angiography (CTA). These tests are routinely done to detect heart disease and help reduce future heart problems. If you choose to participate, it involves activities like filling out a confidential patient information form, possibly a brief physical exam, and randomly being assigned to one of the heart tests your doctor chooses for you.\n\n1. **Procedure**: If you're assigned the CTA, it involves lying in a CT scanner while pictures of your heart are taken. You might receive a contrast injection for clearer images. This is non-invasive, but you have to stay still during the scans.\n\n2. **Risks**: The CT involves x-rays and potentially a contrast injection, which carries small risks like an allergic reaction or kidney issues, though you aren't at high risk for the latter due to your current creatinine levels.\n\n3. **Benefits**: While there may not be direct benefits to you, the information gained could help improve future heart care for others.\n\n4. **Alternatives**: You could opt for standard care without participating in the study, meaning the same tests your doctor recommends, just outside of the study.\n\nYou have the right to opt-out if you're uncomfortable. Do you have any questions or would you like further details on any part of this study?"

I know my serum creatinine looks alright, but I'm still concerned about potential kidney issues with the contrast. Also, can we make sure this won\u2019t take too much time? I prefer to keep things quick."
      },
      {
        "role": "AI assistant",
        "content": "I'll address your concerns one by one. \n\n1. **Random Assignment & Alternatives**: The assignment to either the standard heart tests or the CT angiography (CTA) is indeed random, similar to a coin toss. The purpose of this randomization is to compare the effectiveness of these tests objectively. However, if you're particularly concerned about the CT scan, you do have the option to not participate in the study and instead proceed with the standard heart test your doctor recommends outside the study context. This would allow you more control over the test you undergo. \n\n2. **Kidney Concerns**: Regarding the use of contrast in a CT scan, it's good to know that your serum creatinine levels are well within a healthy range, which lowers the risk of kidney issues. However, it's completely understandable to have concerns. Contrast-induced kidney problems are rare, but not unheard of. Should you decide to participate and get chosen for a CT angiography, the medical team will be vigilant to ensure safety protocols are followed, and they'll be ready to manage any potential issues.\n\n3. **Timing**: Participation doesn't typically require much additional time compared to undergoing these tests routinely. The main additional time commitments derive from filling out forms, possibly a short initial visit, and follow-up questionnaires. These are designed to fit conveniently into your schedule as best as possible.\n\nIf there's anything else you're concerned about or need more time to think about, please let me know. Would you like to proceed with deciding now, or would you prefer to take some time to discuss this further with family or your healthcare provider?"

The important thing is that all standard safety precautions will be in place during the tests, whether you're in the study or not. The healthcare team is experienced and will keep a close watch given your existing conditions, with immediate responses ready should any issues arise.\n\n2. **Time Commitment**: The study does involve some additional time compared to standard testing, specifically for the initial visit and follow-up activities. The initial session, including any brief physical examination and form-filling, might take around 1-2 hours. Follow-up questionnaires can generally be completed in around 20 minutes each and occur at 6-month intervals. These can often be done via phone or mail, reducing the need for travel.\n\n3. **Compensation**: Regarding compensation, the study does not provide monetary compensation for participation, including travel expenses. However, understanding the potential logistical implications, the study team can assist in planning visits to accommodate your needs as best as possible. \n\nIt's important for you to feel comfortable and fully understand the details before deciding. If you have other questions or need more time, that's completely okay.

It is called the PROMISE study, which aims to compare different heart tests to identify heart disease and potentially reduce future heart issues. Since you've experienced new or worsening chest pain and have no known history of heart disease, you have been considered for this study.\n\nThe study will involve you undergoing one of several types of heart tests, such as a treadmill exercise ECG, a stress echocardiogram, a stress nuclear test, or a coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). These tests are all routinely performed to understand heart function, and your doctor will choose the test based on your medical condition.\n\n1. These tests have some potential risks, including exposure to radiation and possible reactions to contrast liquids used during imaging if you undergo a CTA. Most individuals will receive about the same amount of radiation they would naturally accumulate over four years.\n\n2. While participating in this study, you'll be contacted periodically to provide updates about your health, including any new symptoms or hospitalizations.\n\nIt's important to know that your participation is entirely voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without any impact on your regular medical care.\n\nDo you have any questions so far?

By comparing results from exercise treadmill tests, stress echocardiograms, stress nuclear tests, and coronary CTA, the study aims to learn which tests provide the most useful information for diagnosing heart disease early or managing it effectively.\n\nAs for how this might help you specifically, participating in the study can provide detailed insights into your heart health through one of these tests. This can lead to a better understanding of your symptoms and guide effective treatment plans tailored to your needs. However, it\u2019s important to note that there may not be a direct benefit to you right away, as the main aim of the research is to collect data that could benefit future patients.

While there is some risk associated with radiation exposure, medical tests are designed to use the lowest possible dose to achieve effective results. Potential risks from radiation are rare and generally include an extremely small increased risk of cancer over your lifetime.\n   \n   - **Contrast Liquids:** For procedures like CT angiography, a contrast liquid might be used to get clearer images of your heart. Side effects of the contrast can include minor reactions like itching or hives, typically seen in cases of mild allergic reactions. Serious reactions, involving breathing difficulty or changes in blood pressure, are very rare. Patients with specific allergies to contrast dyes are usually identified before they undergo procedures that involve these agents.\n\n2. **Alternatives:**\n   - If you choose not to participate in the study, you will still have access to standard care. Your doctor will discuss and determine the most appropriate heart tests for you based on your symptoms and risk factors like diabetes and hypertension. These tests, such as exercise treadmill tests or stress echo, will be the same types offered in this study and can help diagnose and manage your heart health outside of the research setting.\n   \n   - Your healthcare provider can guide you through these options without the additional follow-up and data collection linked to participating in the study.\n\nBased on what we have discussed, do you feel ready to make a decision about participating in the PROMISE study, or do you have more questions or need time to think about it?"

If your serum creatinine levels haven't recently been tested, a blood sample may be taken.\n\n2. **Assigned Heart Test:** You'll undergo one of the heart tests we discussed earlier. This is a one-time occurrence, similar to what you might receive in standard care, based on your doctor\u2019s evaluation.\n\n3. **Follow-up:**\n   - About 60 days after starting the study, you'll either have an in-person follow-up visit with the study staff at your doctor's office or receive a phone call. During this, you'll be asked about any recent heart symptoms, procedures, or hospitalizations, and your current medications.\n   - Afterward, representatives from the Follow-up Group will contact you by telephone, mail, or email every six months to ask about any new heart symptoms, procedures, hospitalizations, and medications.\n   - At 6 months and once per year, you may be asked additional questions about your well-being and any changes in how you feel or your ability to do daily activities.\n\nThese follow-ups are designed to monitor any health changes over time and involve basic questions about your health and lifestyle.

You have been invited to participate in a research study called the PROMISE Trial at Duke University, which aims to compare different heart tests to identify heart disease and reduce future heart problems. \n\nBefore you decide whether you want to participate, it\u2019s important to understand a few key points about the study, including what\u2019s involved, potential risks, benefits, and alternatives:\n\n1. **Study Purpose:** This study aims to compare various heart tests like the exercise treadmill test, stress echocardiogram, cardiac nuclear imaging, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to see which is best at identifying heart disease.\n\n2. **Involvement:** If you join, you\u2019ll be randomly assigned to one of two groups that will receive one of these diagnostics. For instance, you might undertake a stress ECG, which involves walking on a treadmill while your heart's activity is monitored, or a coronary CTA, which provides detailed imagery of your heart.\n\n3. **Risks:** Each test has its own risks. For instance, the CTA involves exposure to radiation equivalent to about 4 extra years of natural background radiation. There might also be risks related to the contrast liquid used in some imaging techniques, including possible allergic reactions.\n\n4. **Benefits:** There might not be a direct benefit to you, but insights gained might help others in the future.\n\n5. **Voluntary Participation:** Participation is entirely voluntary, and you can leave the study at any time without any penalty or loss of benefits to your regular care.\n\n6. **Alternatives:** If you decide not to participate in the study, you will still receive standard heart testing and treatment recommended by your provider.\n\nConsidering your health profile, especially with risk factors like diabetes and hypertension, this study could provide valuable information for your situation. But it's important that you feel comfortable and informed.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about any part of the study so far?"

        "role": "AI assistant",
        "content": "Certainly! I understand your concerns about radiation exposure and the time commitment involved.\n\n1. **Radiation Exposure:** The coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) exposes you to a level of radiation equivalent to around four extra years' worth of natural background radiation. While any exposure to radiation carries a small potential risk, the level used in medical imaging is considered low and is generally outweighed by the benefits of accurate diagnosis. The long-term risks from such a level of radiation are deemed minimal, but it's essential to weigh this against the potential benefit of detecting heart issues that might otherwise remain unseen.\n\n2. **Time Commitment:** Participation in the study could last anywhere from a minimum of 2 years up to 6 years, depending on when you join and the study timeline. Initially, there will be a baseline visit to collect your medical history and possibly some blood tests. After the initial test, follow-up visits or calls will be conducted approximately every 6 months. These follow-ups are designed to monitor any changes in your health status and collect valuable data for the study. You won\u2019t need frequent visits to the clinic, as some follow-ups can be done over the phone.\n\nIf you have any other questions or would like further details on any study aspects, please don't hesitate to ask. Based on this information, do you feel you have what you need to decide, or is there anything else you\u2019d like to know?"

Having follow-ups that can be done over the phone seems convenient.\n\nI just have one more question about the contrast liquid used in the imaging techniques like the CTA. Are there any specific risks or side effects I should be aware of, especially considering my kidney function, since I understand the creatinine level can be a concern with contrast use?"

        "content": "Great question! With regard to the contrast liquid used in a coronary CTA, there are some important points to consider:\n\n1. **Contrast Liquid Risks:** The contrast liquid used in CTAs helps to create clearer images of your heart. There is a risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast, which can include symptoms like itching, hives, difficulty breathing, and in rare cases, more severe reactions like a drop in blood pressure or loss of consciousness. It\u2019s important to let the medical staff know if you\u2019ve had allergic reactions to contrast agents in the past.\n\n2. **Kidney Function:** You're correct in being mindful of kidney function when it comes to contrast use. High levels of creatinine can indicate reduced kidney function, which might raise concerns about the use of contrast. However, your serum creatinine level is within normal range, which suggests that your kidneys are functioning well at this time. Your doctor will assess your kidney function before the procedure and determine if it's safe to proceed with the contrast agent.\n\nThe medical team will closely monitor you for any adverse reactions during and after the procedure. If any issues arise, they will be ready to manage them immediately.\n\nIt\u2019s great that you\u2019re considering all aspects carefully. Based on the details we\u2019ve discussed, do you feel prepared to make a decision regarding your participation in the study, or do you still have any lingering questions or concerns?"

A high Agatston score, like yours, indicates significant calcified plaque in the coronary arteries, which could suggest a higher risk for heart disease.\n\nHere's a simple breakdown of the procedure:\n\n1. **Preparation and Positioning**: You'll lie on a table that slides into the donut-shaped CT scanner. It's important to stay still during the scan to get clear images.\n\n2. **Contrast Injection**: A contrast liquid may be injected into your vein. This helps provide clearer images by highlighting your heart and blood vessels. If you've had previous issues with contrast agents, please let the team know.\n\n3. **Breathing Instructions**: You may be asked to hold your breath for short periods to minimize motion and aid image clarity.\n\n4. **The Scan**: The scanner will take X-ray pictures in quick succession, which are later combined into detailed 3D images of your heart.\n\nAs for the **risks**, they include:\n- Exposure to radiation. The dose is equivalent to about 4 extra years' worth of natural background radiation.\n- Reactions to the contrast liquid, such as allergic reactions or kidney complications. However, these risks are relatively low.\n\n**Benefits** include getting a clear view of your heart's arteries, helping your doctor understand your heart's health better and potentially guiding further treatment.\n\nAs an alternative, you could undergo other standard heart tests like a stress echo or nuclear imaging.

While any exposure to radiation carries a small increase in cancer risk, the risk from this level of exposure is very low. It's important to weigh this against the potential benefits of the scan in diagnosing any serious heart conditions that could impact your health if left unchecked.\n\n2. **Contrast Liquid**: The contrast agent used in CTAs helps provide clearer images of your heart. While most people tolerate the contrast well, possible reactions can include mild issues like itchiness or nausea and rare serious reactions like kidney problems or allergic responses. For most individuals without preexisting kidney problems or known allergies to contrast agents, long-term effects are not common.\n\nIn both cases, the medical team will take precautions to minimize risks. If there are any reasons you might be especially susceptible to these effects, such as kidney issues or past reactions, they can adjust the approach or consider alternative testing options.\n\nThe information and precise imaging from the CTA could be instrumental in managing your heart health, potentially preventing more severe issues in the future. However, you have the right to weigh these risks and considerations.\n\nI hope this helps clarify things.

This follow-up can be via telephone, mail, or email\u2014aimed at tracking any heart symptoms, procedures, hospitalizations, and your medication changes. Once a year, you\u2019ll also discuss your overall health and activities.\n   \n   The frequency of follow-ups can spread over a few years, potentially fitting into your regular life without frequent hospital visits, but this depends on the procedures' and your health needs. On occasion, the study might require a visit, which will be scheduled to accommodate your regular routines.\n\n2. **Compensation**: There isn't any financial compensation for participating in this study. The primary incentive is the contribution to medical research that may benefit future patients with heart conditions. Some costs related to the tests may be covered by the grant, although you'll be responsible for certain potential costs, similar to what your insurance would cover if you were undergoing standard care outside of the study.\n\nOverall, participating in this research study provides you with structured testing and follow-up, contributing valuable data toward advancements in heart disease diagnostics and treatment. But as you consider these aspects, know that participating in this study is entirely voluntary, and saying no has no penalty regarding your regular healthcare access.\n\nGiven all these details, how are you feeling about making a decision? Do you think you might want to participate, need more time to consider, or have more questions before deciding?"

However, I'm still concerned about not receiving any compensation, especially considering the time and personal health risks involved. Given my high Agatston score and other risk factors, I'm not sure if participating will benefit me personally enough to outweigh the concerns. I think I need a bit more time to consider all of this and maybe talk it over with my family before making a decision. Can I get back to you later on my decision?"

Taking such a step is important, especially when weighing the potential benefits and concerns regarding your health.\n\nTo provide some reassurance, it's important to note that all participation is entirely voluntary. If you decide not to participate, there will be no penalty regarding your regular healthcare or access to treatments outside of this study. Your health and family conversations are a priority.\n\nRegarding further assistance, if at any point you have questions or decide to proceed, you can contact Dr. John A.
